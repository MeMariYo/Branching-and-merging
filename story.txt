The story is about a lazy video game programmer who has a legendary grimoire. It takes place in New York. Virtual reality addiction is a major part of the story.
One morning, the lazy programmer has diareha and rushes to the toilet. He doesn't make it and now he was to throw away his boxers.
I don't know what I'm doing! Where do I do I gotta go???
The programmer needs new boxers.
where is the next store?
Lets try Wal-mart? They sell boxers for the low! I hope it's not packed; I have to meet my dealer in 10 minutes!
Let me use my girmoire to cast some magic!
